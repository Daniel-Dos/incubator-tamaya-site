= Configuration beyond Java EE8

Anatole held a talk about Tamaya at Javaland 2017:

* https://www.javaland.eu/[Javaland]
* https://www.slideshare.net/AnatoleTresch/configuration-beyond-java-ee-8[Anatole's slides]

The talk was attended by roughly 30 people and lively discussions about Tamaya and Microprofile.io followed. Currently Tamaya seems in good shape to tackle the future of configuration in Java.
