== Verifying Releases

It is essential that you verify the integrity of any downloaded files using
the PGP or MD5 signatures.  For more information on signing artifacts and
why we do it, check out the
http://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing.html[Release Signing FAQ^].

The PGP signatures can be verified using PGP or GPG. First download the
http://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/tamaya/KEYS[KEYS file^]
as well as the asc signature file for the artifact. Make sure you get
these files from the
http://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/tamaya/[main distribution directory^]
rather than from a
http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/tamaya/[mirror^].
Then verify the signatures using e.g.:

[source,shell]
----
$ pgpk -a KEYS
$ pgpv tamaya-project-1.2.0-source-release.zip.asc
----

or
[source,shell]
----
$ pgp -ka KEYS
$ pgp tamaya-project-1.2.0-source-release.zip.asc
----

or

[source,shell]
----
$ gpg --import KEYS
$ gpg --verify tamaya-project-1.2.0-source-release.zip.asc
----
