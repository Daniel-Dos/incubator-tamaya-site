= Apache Tamaya: Release Guide

Performing a release requires several steps. This document describes each step, so everybody in the committer's
team should be able to perform the release procedure.


== Tell the others you would proceed with the release procedure

first steps for the next release

Hi @ all,

If there are no objections, I'll start with the first steps for
the next release (review, documentation,...).
It would be great to start with the release procedure next week.

Best regards,
[name]
----

== Check everything is ready

* Check the jenkins builds.
* Ensure all JIRA-tickets targeting the release are resolved. If not, get in contact with the ticket
  owner/assignee to check
  ** if the ticket can be postponed for the next release
  ** how long it takes to resolve it and if one can help.


== Prepare the release

* Create release notes and commit them to `tamaya/readme/` (format `ReleaseNotes-[version].html`)
* Create a release branch in git and switch to this branch:


=== Using the Release Plugin

For performing the release you can use the maven release plugin:

[listing,text]
----
$ git checkout -b vote-tamaya-[release version]
$ export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=200m"
$ mvn release:prepare -DdryRun=true -DperformRelease=true
# optionally pass GPG params for signing with: -Darguments="-Dgpg.keyname=1336D3E6 -Dgpg.passphrase=XXXXXX"
# copy prepared workspace (to continue faster if an upload fails in the next step)
----

* If something fails you may switch to the master branch, fix whatever is needed and rebase your release branch to
  accommodate the latest changes done.
* On success you can check the release packages from `dist/target`.
* If everything looks good you can proceed with the release:

[listing,text]
----
$ export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=200m"
$ mvn release:prepare -DperformRelease=true
$ mvn release:perform -DperformRelease=true
----

=== Preparing the release without the Release Plugin

The release plugin is great, but in some cases it breaks even, when release:prepare -DdryRun=true was successful.
Preparing the release vote without the release plugin is stright forward:

* As described checkout a release branch of the current head
* Then us maven and git commands to prepare the release:

[listing,text]
----
$ git checkout -b vote-tamaya-[release version]
$ export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=200m"
$ mvn versions:set versions:commit -DnewVersion=[release version] -DperformRelease=true
# build the release locally and sign it with your certs
$ mvn clean install -DperformRelease=true -Dgpg.keyname=1336D3E6 -Dgpg.passphrase=XXXXXX
----

* Check if everything is in place and correct, when finished you can tag and deploy the release...

[listing,text]
----
$ mvn deploy -DperformRelease=true -Dgpg.keyname=1336D3E6 -Dgpg.passphrase=XXXXXX
----

* check the created commits including user-name and email
* login to https://repository.apache.org/[^] and go to "Staging Repositories"
* check the contents of the newly created tamaya staging repository
* _close_ the repository to let Nexus do its validations
* On success:
* push the release-branch to the git repo

[listing,text]
----
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Release Prepare: Set release version."
$ git tag vote01-[release-version]
$ git push --tags
----

Finally open the next development version:

[listing,text]
----
# example: newVersion=0.3-incubating-SNAPSHOT
$ mvn version:set versions:commit -DnewVersion=[development-version]
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Release Prepare: Open new development version."
----



* Add the distribution artifacts to the dev repositories:

[listing,text]
----
$ svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/tamaya/
$ mkdir [version]
$ set RELEASE_HOME='pwd'/[version]
$ cd PROJECT_ROOT
$ cp DISCLAIMER $RELEASE_HOME
$ cp NOTICE $RELEASE_HOME
$ cp LICENCE $RELEASE_HOME
$ cp rat.txt $RELEASE_HOME
# Copy everything from
#  $STAGING_REPO/distribution/0.2-incubating/tamaya-distribution-[version]-distribution-* into $RELEASE_HOME
$ svn add [version]
$ svn commit --username <apacheId>
----

* Check contents on https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/tamaya/[version]


== Start the vote

[VOTE] Release of Apache Tamaya [version]

Hi,

I was running the needed tasks to get the [version] release of Apache Tamaya out.

The tag is available at [3] and will renamed once the vote passed.

Please take a look at the artifacts and vote!

Please note:
This vote is a "majority approval" with a minimum of three +1 votes (see [5]).

------------------------------------------------
[ ] +1 for community members who have reviewed the bits
