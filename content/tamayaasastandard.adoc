= Tamaya as a Standard

Apache Tamaya (incubating) actually supports several configuration standards to
provide a long term stable configuration solution.


== JSR 382

Tamaya implements a recent state of the Configuration JSR. The exact commit
version of the JSR API implemented (the JSR has not yet released any version
as of now) can be evaluated by looking at the _tamaya-jsr382_ `pom.xml` in the
sandbox repository.

To use Tamaya as a JSR-382 Configuration provider you must add the following
dependency:

[source,xml]
---------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.tamaya.ext</groupId>
    <artifactId>tamaya-jsr382</artifactId>
    <version>${tamaya.version}</version>
</dependency>
---------

Since this component is not yet officially released you must use the current snapshot
version +0.4-incubating-SNAPSHOT+. In order for that to work, you need to add the Apache Snapshot Repository to your build:

[source,xml]
---------
<repository>
    <id>apache.snapshots</id>
    <name>Apache Development Snapshot Repository</name>
    <url>https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>
    <releases>
        <enabled>false</enabled>
    </releases>
    <snapshots>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
    </snapshots>
</repository>
---------


== Microprofile Configuration API

Tamaya implements the Microprofile Configuration API Version 1.1. To use Tamaya
as a Micropropfile Configuration provider you must add the following dependency:

[source,xml]
---------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.tamaya.ext</groupId>
    <artifactId>tamaya-microprofile</artifactId>
    <version>${tamaya.version}</version>
</dependency>
---------


== OSGi ConfigAdmin

Tamaya's OSGi Support leverages the OSGi +org.osgi.service.cm.ConfigurationAdmin+
configuration manager as defined in OSGi Compendium Version +4.3.1+. Hereby
Tamaya can add or modify Configuration in OSGi, which may trigger change events.
The exact behaviour can be controlled in many ways. By default Tamaya, does not change
anything, when deployed in OSGi, without being configured todo so. For details
check link:documentation/extensions/mod_osgi.html[Tamaya's OSGi Documentation].
