[[Optional]]
== Tamaya OSGI Support
=== Overview

Tamaya provides also support for integration with OSGI. Hereby several options are available how Tamaya can be used in
an OSGI context:

. All Tamaya modules, its API and core library are actually valid OSGI bundles. So adding them into your OSGI modules
  and using Tamaya is basically directly supported. Nevertheless OSGI works rather differently from a class- and
  resource loading perspective. As long as you rely on Tamaya's mechanisms for resource loading things should work
  out of the box. In the back Tamaya's core module actually comes with implicit OSGI support, which is automatically
  activated, if Tamaya is running in an OSGI context. This support actually
  ** Listens on deployed bundles and actively reads all resources configured as +java.util.ServiceLoader+ services and
     registers them as OSGI services. Hereby integration is complete meaning you can also register Tamaya services
     as normal OSGI services, e.g. your own +PropertySource+ instances.
  ** Uses the OSGI bundle to resolve for resources, because accessing them from the classloader directly
     typically fails in an OSGI context.
. Adding Tamaya's OSGI integration module replaces the existing OSGI +ConfigAdmin+ service with an istance based on
  Tamaya. Hereby several aspects can be configured using system properties:
  ** +org.tamaya.integration.osgi.cm.ranking+ (int) allows to configure the OSGI service ranking used by the Tamaya
    BundleActivator to register Tamaya's +ConfigAdmin+ service. In OSGI higher ranking precede lower rankings. By default
    Tamaya's OSGI extending service registration mechanism is reusing any annotated +@Priority+ priority values as
    corresponsing rankings.
  ** +org.tamaya.integration.osgi.cm.override+ (boolean) allows to configure if Tamaya is overriding any existing
    values from the default +ConfigAdmin+ instance, or only extending them. In other words this setting allows you to
    define, which configuration subsystem has precedence for evaluating the final values, either Tamaya based
    configuration (default) or the configuration mechanisms provided by default from your OSGI container (when this flag
    is set to +false+).
  ** +org.tamaya.integration.osgi.cm.inject+ allows you to deactivate injection of configuration values into your
    OSGI services (by default injection is enabled). In all cases accessing the OSGI +ConfigAdmin+ service to
    read your configuration is working as usual. But Tamaya adds additional injection functionality, which allows
    to inject typed configuration as described by the Tamaya injection api.

It is also possible to combine things, e.g. when you only define a low ranking for Tamaya's configuration service and
the same time allow injection to be active, you will have Tamaya's injection support based on your default
OSGI configuration.


=== Compatibility

All module described are based on Java 7, so it will run on Java 7 and beyond.
The modules are built against OSGI Compendium version 5.0.


=== Installation

To benefit from Tamaya in an OSGI context you must deploy at least the following modules to your OSGI runtime
environment:

[source, listing]
-----------------------------------------------
# API and core
org.apache.tamaya:tamaya-api:{tamaya_version}
org.apache.tamaya:tamaya-core:{tamaya_version}
org.apache.geronimo.specs:geronimo-annotation_1.2_spec:1.0-alpha-1
# injection API. SE injection module and dependencies
org.apache.tamaya.ext:tamaya-injection-api:{tamaya_version}
org.apache.tamaya.ext:tamaya-injection:{tamaya_version}
org.apache.geronimo.specs:geronimo-atinject_1.0_spec:1.0
org.apache.geronimo.specs:geronimo-el_2.2_spec:1.0.4
org.apache.geronimo.specs:geronimo-interceptor_1.1_spec:1.0
org.apache.geronimo.specs:geronimo-jcdi_1.1_spec:1.0
# OSGI integration and dependencies
org.apache.tamaya.ext:tamaya-osgi:{tamaya_version}
org.apache.tamaya.ext:tamaya-functions:{tamaya_version}
-----------------------------------------------


=== Usage

As an example, what is possible you can implement an OSGI service as a normal POJO and publish it as an OSGI service.
Given that configuration can be injected very easily:

[source, java]
-----------------------------------------------
public class HelloServiceImpl implements HelloService{

    @Config("example.message")
    @ConfigDefault("A Tamaya default.")
    private String message;

    @Override
    public String sayHello() {
        System.err.println("HELLO: " + message);
        return message;
    }
}
-----------------------------------------------


=== SPI

By default the OSGI pid or factory pid is mapped to a corresponding root section in Tamaya's configuration. We are
well aware that this might not always be the desired approach. Therefore there as an SPI service provided that allows
to determine this mapping:

[source, java]
.OSGIConfigRootMapper
-----------------------------------------------
public interface OSGIConfigRootMapper {

    String getTamayaConfigRoot(String pid, String factoryPid);
}
-----------------------------------------------

Registering your own implementation as an OSGI service allows you to redefine the key mapping.
By default a configuration mapping for +pid/factoryPid==myBundle+ is mapped to +[bundle:myBundle]+.
This mapping is used as a prefix when collecting the corresponding entries for the OSGI configuration.
