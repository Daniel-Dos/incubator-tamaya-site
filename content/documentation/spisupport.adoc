[[SPISupport]]
== Tamaya SPI Support (Extension Module)

Tamaya _SPI Support_ is an core module only dependong on the API. It implements lots of API and SPI related
artifacts in portable way. Tamaya's core module reuses this functionality to build up a full fledged
Tamaya API implementatation.


=== What functionality this module provides ?

Tamaya _SPI Support_ provides a few helpful base classes that can be used to implement aspects of Tamaya:

* +BasePropertySource+ provides an abstract *base class* for implementation of your own PropertySources.
* +DefaultConfiguration+ provides you with a simple implementation of the +Configuration+ interface based on a
  +ConfigurationContext+ provided. This is also very useful for mocking configuration during test execution, but
  not only constraint to that use case.
* +DefaultConfigurationContext+ provides you with a working implementation of the +ConfigurationContext+.
* Numerous *converters*, including an +EnumConverter+ is a converter implementation that can automatically select the currect enumeration values based
  on a configured entry.
* +MapPropertySource+ implements a property source based on +java.util.Map+.
* +PriorityServiceComparator+ compares arbitrary services based on their +@Priority+ annotations (also handling the
  case, where no such annotation is present).
* +PropertiesResourcePropertySource+ is an implementation of a +PropertySource+ based on a +Properties+ instance,
  lodable from any +URL+.
+ +PropertyConverterManager+ is a service class very useful, when implementing instances of +ConfigurationContext+.
  It manages registered instances of +PropertyConverter+ and provides easy to use type conversion logic.
+ +PropertyFiltering+ provides another helpful class that manages +PropertyFilter+ instances and provides an
  easy to use high level API.
+ +PropertySourceComparator+ provides an implementation that compares +PropertySources+ based on their +getOrdinal()+
  values and their class names.
+ The default configuration implementation also allows to replace the raw value evaluation
  logic using a +ConfigValueEvaluator+, similar to Tamaya's core implementation.

NOTE: It is highly recommended that you read also the link:../core.html[documentation] of Tamaya's
      implementation core, since this describes the abstrations in use in more
      detail. This module allows to reuse Tamaya's implementation artifacts but
      still allow alternate implementations of the core API to be used.


=== Compatibility

The module is based on Java 8, so it will run on Java 8 and beyond.


=== Installation

To use Tamaya's _spisupport_ you only must add the corresponding dependency to your module:

[source, xml]
-----------------------------------------------
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.tamaya</groupId>
  <artifactId>tamaya-spisupport</artifactId>
  <version>{tamaya_version}</version>
</dependency>
-----------------------------------------------

The component will not register any components but only providing portable base classes for some common SPI
implementation tasks. It only depends on the API, so it should be safely reusable also with other implementations
of the Tamaya API similarly.
