== Tamaya Metamodel: Staged PropertySources (Extension Module)
=== Overview

The Tamaya Staged PropertySources extension provides a base class and default implementation for loading
multistaged configuration easily from a common configuration location.


=== Compatibility

The module is based on Java 7, so it will not run on Java 7 and beyond.


=== Installation

To benefit from Tamaya CDI integration you only must add the corresponding dependency to your module:

[source, xml]
-----------------------------------------------
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.tamaya.ext.metamodels</groupId>
  <artifactId>tamaya-metamodel.staged</artifactId>
  <version>{tamayaVersion}</version>
</dependency>
-----------------------------------------------

The component will not register any components. The component basically provides the following options:

* Use it as default configuration extension. Hereby you should define your stages in use by setting the
  +env.STAGE+ system property with the stages to be loaded in order of precedence (most significant last),
  e.g. +sys-env,DEFAULTS,TEST,DEVELOPMENT. _Additionally_ you must register
  +org.apache.tamaya.staged.StagedConfigPropertiesProvider+ as in

--------------------------------------------------------------
META-INF
|_service
  |_org.apache.tamaya.spi.PropertySourceProvider
--------------------------------------------------------------

Tamaya will then load .properties files from +System.getenv(),
classpath:DEFAULTS.properties, classpath:TEST.properties+ and
+classpath:DEVELOPMENT.properties+

* For more advanced requirements, such as alternate locations, patterns or formats, you can also extend one of the
  provided classes (+org.apache.tamaya.staged.StagedConfigPropertiesProvider+,
  ** +BaseStagedPropertySourceProvider+). Extending provides features such as:

  ** Defining a prefix for all entries provided/loaded.
  ** Using alternate locations or formats.
  ** Defining the ordinals used.
