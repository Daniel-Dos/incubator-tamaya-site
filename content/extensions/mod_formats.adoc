[[Core]]
== Tamaya Formats (Extension Module)
=== Overview

Tamaya Formats is an extension module. Refer to the link:modules.html[extensions documentation] for further details.

Tamaya Formats provides an abstraction for configuration formats provding the following benefits:

* Parsing of resources in can be implemented separately from interpreting the different aspects/parts parsed. As an
  example a file format can define different sections. Depending on the company specific semantics of the sections
  a different set of +PropertySource+ instances must be created.
* Similarly the configuration abstraction can also be used as an interface for integrating Tamaya with alternate
  frameworks that provide logic for reading configuration files, such as Apache commons.configuration.

=== Compatibility

The module is based on Java 7, so it can be used with Java 7 and beyond.

=== Installation

To benefit from dynamic value resolution you only must add the corresponding dependency to your module:

[source, xml]
-----------------------------------------------
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.tamaya.ext</groupId>
  <artifactId>tamaya-formats</artifactId>
  <version>{tamayaVersion}</version>
</dependency>
-----------------------------------------------

The module automatically registers an according +PropertyFilter+ that is automatically called, whenever a value
is accessed.

=== The Idea

Formats should be reusable, meaning you should have to write a format parser only once and then be able to map the data read into whatever
data structure (in our cases: property sources).

==== ConfigurationData

Configuration formats can be very different. Some are simpley key/value pairs, whereas other also consist of multiple sections (e.g. ini-files) or
hierarchical data (e.g. yaml, xml). This is solved in Tamaya by mapping the configuration read into a normalized intermediary format called
+ConfigurationData+:

[source,java]
.ConfigurationData
-------------------------------------------------------
public final class ConfigurationData {

    public ConfigurationFormat getFormat();
    public String getResource();

    public Set<String> getSectionNames();
    public Map<String,String> getSection(String name);
    public Map<String,Map<String,String>> getSections();

    public boolean hasDefaultProperties();
    public Map<String,String> getDefaultProperties();

    public Map<String,String> getCombinedProperties();
    public boolean hasCombinedProperties();

    public boolean isEmpty();
}
-------------------------------------------------------

In detail the data read from a file is organized into _sections_ as follows:

* with +getResource()+ and +getFormat()+ the underlying resource and the format that read this data can be accessed.
* properties can be owned by
  ** named sections
  ** an (unnamed) default section
* each section section contains a map of properties. Hereby the same key can be part of the default section and multiple
  named sections, depending on the configuration format.
* The method +getSectionNames()+ returns a set of all section names.
* With +getSection(String name)+ a named section can be accessed.
* With +getDefaultSection()+ the default section can be accessed.
* With +getCombinedProperties()+ a flattened entry map can be accessed built up (by default) out of
  ** all entries from the default section, without any changes.
  ** all entries from named sections, where the key for each entry is prefix with the section name and a dot separator.
* The configuration format used determines the mapping of configuration data read into this structure. The format
  implementation can as well provide alternate implementations of how the data read should be mapped into the
  combined properties map.

Now for the conversion of +ConfigurationData+ into a +PropertySource+ different default approaches are used:

. The +ConfigurationFormat+ that read the data can provide the (combined) properties accessible from
  +getProperties()+ explcitly, which can be used to initialize a single +PropertySource+ containing the data read.
. If the format did not set the final properties, but only a default section is present this default section
  can be directly returned as combined properties.
. In all other cases a properties can be uniquely mapped into one single properties Map, by prefixing all keys of each
  section present with the (unique) section name and a '.' separator.

Nevertheless, depending on the context, where a configuration source was read (classloader, time, source etc.) the
resulting +PropertySource+ can have different semnatics, especially for the +PropertySources+ ordinal. Also section
names may be mapped into different ordinals instead of using them as key prefixes (e.g. imagine configuration formats
with a 'default', 'main', and 'overrides' sections). For such more complex or custom cases no useful default mapping
can be defined. In such cases this functionality must be implemented in a _mapData_ method, which converts
the normalized +ConfigData+ read to the appropriate collection of +PropertySource+ instances:


==== ConfigurationFormat

A ConfigurationFormat is basically an abstraction that reads a configuration resource (modelled by an InputStream) and
creates a corresponding +ConfigurationData+ instance.

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------
public interface ConfigurationFormat {

    public String getName();
    boolean accepts(URL url);
    ConfigurationData readConfiguration(String resource, InputStream inputStream);
}
-------------------------------------------------------


Normally you need to map the resulting +ConfigurationData+ to one or multiple +PropertySources+. In case, where the
properties provided match exactly the extected properties a +FlattenedDefaultPropertySource+ is provided out-of-the-box.
If the exact mapping must be overridden, you can simply override the property source's initialize method to adapt the
mapping:

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------
ConfigurationData data = ...;
FlattenedDefaultPropertySource ps = new FlattenedDefaultPropertySource(data){
  protected Map<String, String> populateData(ConfigurationData data) {
    ...
  }
};
-------------------------------------------------------


=== How to tranform ConfigurationData into a PropertySource

The Tamaya main building block for configuration properties is the +PropertySource+ interface. You have several
options to implement this tranformation:

. You can simply map the properties returned by +getCombinedProperties()+ and use them as properties returned by a
  wrapping property source. Since this use case is common for all kind of non hierarchic configuration formats it
  is directly supported by the +FlattenedDefaultPropertySource+ class.
. When the +ConfigurationFormat+ is more complex, multiple 'sections' are common. What a section exactly is depends on
  the concrete format only. The +ConfigurationFormat+ should provide detailed information how the data read is
  mapped to default properties and sections and how it is assembled into the +combinedProperties+ map. Also here
  the +FlattenedDefaultPropertySource+ class can help you with its default mapping. Nevertheless in some cases it is
  necessary to write an explicit mapping, e.g. when
  . different sections must be mapped to multiple +PropertySources+, with optionally fixed ordinals.
  . sections must be cross-checked and combined into new properties, or into several +PropertySources+.
  . other complex mapping requirements apply.

=== Examples

==== Mapping ini-Files

Consider the following ini-file:

[source,listing]
.Example.ini
-------------------------------------------------------
a=valA
a.b=valB

[section1]
aa=sectionValA
aa.b.c=SectionValC

[section2]
a=val2Section2
-------------------------------------------------------

This file content coud be mapped to the following structure:

[source,listing]
.Mapping of Example.ini
-------------------------------------------------------
a=valA
a.b=valB
section1.valA=sectionValA
section1.a.b.c=SectionValC
section2.a=val2Section2
-------------------------------------------------------

Nevertheless from the +ConfigurationData+ instance a more complex algorithm can access all the different parts:

* the_default_ properties (a, a.b)
* the section +section1+, with properties +aa, aa.b.c+
* the section +section2+, qith properties +a+


==== Mapping xml-Files

The same concept can also be applied to xml-files. Consider the following configuration file:

[source,xml]
.Example.conf
-------------------------------------------------------
<config>
  <default>
    <a>valA</a>
    <a.b>valB</a.B>
  </default>

  <section id="section1">
    <param id="aa">sectionValA</aa>
    <param id="aa.b.c">SectionValC</aa.b.c>
  </section>
  <section id="section2">
    <param id="a">val2Section2</aa>
  </section>
</config>
-------------------------------------------------------

This file basically describes the same configuration as the ini-based version we have seen before. The formats
module hereby ships with 3 format classes:

* +PropertiesFormat+ providing support for .properties files.
* +PropertiesXmlFormat+ providing support for xml.property files.
* +IniConfiguratonFormat+ providing support for xml.property files.
